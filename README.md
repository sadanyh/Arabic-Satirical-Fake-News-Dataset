# Satirical-Fake-News-Dataset

This is a dataset for Arabic satirical fake news. It is scraped from two satirical news websites, Al-Hudood and Al-Ahram Al-Mexici. All the dataset in this repo should have the positive label 'Fake'. If you plan to train a classifier for fake news detection, we suggest supplementing your data with any real news dataset. You can find open-source real news data in sites such as SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ar-text-mining/files/Arabic-Corpora/

If you use our fake dataset, please cite the following paper:
